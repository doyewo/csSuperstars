# This is a quick checklist of how youâ€™re going to be graded for this assignment.
- significant number of commits for your project, preferably daily
- well-organized code (use of OOP, classes/interfaces)
- appropriate documentation, especially to clarify your understanding of the requirements (this should be a README - - - document or Google Doc linked to your README).
- more unit tests than actual code
- interactive program that shows how to use your API (optional if all methods are tested with unit tests)
- good use of classes and objects and library classes (instead of reinventing your own), especially when it comes to - - core data structures (lists, tables/dictionaries, string handling, etc.)
- citation of any ideas that inspired you, including other users on GitHub (or hosting sites in general), StackOverflow, etc.
